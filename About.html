   <p>The creeps have been hustling Salmon Cookies since 2002. It all started when Steve Creep was on a fishing trip in Alaska. Steve was just chillen there with his pal Frank eating some cookies and an Idea poped into his brain: why not combine the two things I love the most in life, cookies and salmon. He turned to Frank and said "Frank, I know what I want to do in life". Steve left Alaska that night to rush back to his tent in the jungle under I-5 where he explained to his wife, Sheri Moon, that he was quitting his job as a male stripper to start making cookies in the shape of salmon. They bought some baking sheets, cookie cutters shaped like salmon, and a easybake oven.
     Little did they know it would grow into the phenomenon it is today.
